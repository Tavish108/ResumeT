          <h2><b>ABOUT</b></h2>
          <p>I am Tavish Sharma, a 3rd-year B.Tech student at KIET, with a passion for technology, innovation, and
            leadership. I specialize in AI engineering, web development, and AR/VR technologies, leading the AR/VR
            division at my club,
            Innogenks. I have experience designing and optimizing rockets during my internship at Feynman Aerospace and
            have successfully managed projects that combine software, data integration, and user experience. I actively
            participate in hackathons,
            including being selected among the top 40 teams in Hack the Mountain 5.0. I am currently working on projects
            like Musify, a platform for local artists, and a job recommendation website integrating ATS optimization. My
            goal is to continuously learn, mentor others, and contribute to impactful projects that bridge technology
            and real-world solutions.</p>
